# Customer Churn Prediction

## Goal
Predict which customers are likely to stop using a service, helping businesses proactively reduce churn and improve retention.

## Dataset
The dataset simulates customer behavior from a **banking platform**, including features such as:
- Age
- Tenure
- Balance
- Number of Products
- Has Credit Card
- Is Active Member
- Estimated Salary
- Exited (Target variable)

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed to uncover churn patterns across:
- Age groups
- Account activity
- Credit card usage
- Balance and salary distributions

Visualizations helped identify key trends and correlations that influence customer churn.

## Models Used
To classify churn risk, the following models were implemented:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

## Evaluation Metrics
Model performance was evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Recall
- ROC-AUC Score
- Confusion Matrix

## Feature Importance
Feature importance plots were generated to highlight the most influential variables driving churn, aiding interpretability and business decision-making.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- seaborn, matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
